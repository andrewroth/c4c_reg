Suggested Process for Adding a New Model
----------------------------------------


0. Migrate to version 0 to prepare for foreign keys and seed_fu
   (if you don't do this now you may just have to manually drop all tables in the database later)
   e.g.
     rake db:migrate VERSION=0


1. Create new model with generator.
   e.g.
     script/generate scaffold ModelNameSingular record_column:data_type
       or
     script/generate model ModelNameSingular record_column:data_type


2. Then edit the generated migration to make sure it's okay (e.g. add in necessary not null, default or limit properties).
   And you may want to remove the timestamps that rails puts in automatically.
   (Rails migration cheat sheet: http://dizzy.co.uk/ruby_on_rails/cheatsheets/rails-migrations)
   e.g.
     :null => false, :limit => 128, :default => 0
  

3. Create necessary relationship associations.
   e.g.
     belongs_to :person, :foreign_key => _(:person_id)
     has_many :cash_transactions


4. Update database foreign key migration using foreigner plugin and change the date in the filename so that it's the most recent migration.
  (there can be only one add_foreign_keys migration)
   e.g.
     add_foreign_key(:registrations, :people, :dependent => :delete)
  
     remove_foreign_key(:registrations, :people)
  
  
5. Create seed fixture for new table using seed_fu plugin (seed fixtures are applied in alphabetical order).
   e.g.
     Registration.seed_many([
      {
        :id => 1,
        :event_id => "1",
        :person_id => "1",
        :date => "2010-09-01",
        :confirm_num => "E60R8899C79",
        :status_id => "2",
        :balance => "10"
      }
    ])


6. Add new table to mappings.yml.
   e.g.
     databases:
       cim_prod: assignment
       
     assignment:
       id: assignment_id
       status_id: assignmentstatus_id 


7. Modify routes.rb as needed (you may just want to delete the auto-generated resource routes).


8. Migrate to apply all changes.
   e.g.
     rake db:migrate
     

9. Do seeding with seed_fu.
   (NOTE: seed_fu will not work when db_mappings are in use, move/remove the mappings.yml file before running the rake)
   e.g.
     rake db:seed_fu
