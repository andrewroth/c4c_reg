Suggested Process for Adding a New Model
----------------------------------------

1. Create new model with generator.
   e.g.
     script/generate scaffold ModelNamePlural record_column:data_type
       or
     script/generate model ModelNameSingular record_column:data_type


2. Then edit the generated migration to make sure it's okay (e.g. add in necessary not null, default or limit properties).
   And you may want to remove the timestamps that rails puts in automatically.
   (Rails migration cheat sheet: http://dizzy.co.uk/ruby_on_rails/cheatsheets/rails-migrations)
   e.g.
     :null => false, :limit => 128, :default => 0
  

3. Create necessary relationship associations in the generated model rb.
   e.g.
     belongs_to :person, :foreign_key => _(:person_id)
     has_many :cash_transactions, :foreign_key => _(:registration_id, :cash_transaction)


4. Update database foreign key migration using Foreigner plugin (*_add_foreign_keys.rb).
   e.g.
     add_foreign_key(:registrations, :people, :dependent => :delete)
  
     remove_foreign_key(:registrations, :people)
  
  
5. Create seed fixture for new table using Seed_fu plugin.
   e.g.
     Registration.seed_many([
      {
        :id => 1,
        :event_id => "1",
        :person_id => "1",
        :date => "2010-09-01",
        :confirm_num => "E60R8899C79",
        :status_id => "2",
        :balance => "10"
      }
    ])


6. Add new table to mappings.yml if needed.
   e.g.
     databases:
       cim_prod: assignment
       
     assignment:
       id: assignment_id
       status_id: assignmentstatus_id 


7. Modify routes.rb as needed (you may just want to delete the auto-generated resource routes).


8. Migrate to version 0 (to prepare for new seeds) and back to newest version to apply all changes.
   e.g.
     rake db:migrate VERSION=0
     rake db:migrate
     

9. Do seeding with Seed_fu.
   e.g.
     rake db:seed_fu
